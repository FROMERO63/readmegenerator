# readmegenerator

## Description

This motivation for this project was to use node to create a readme generator
I wanted to allow the user to be able to be prompted for questions and have a readme generated with their responses
I also added a feature where you could click on the sections in the table of contents and be sent to that section
This solved the problem of having to write a readme everytime you create a project
Some things that I learned in this challenge were how to use node, inquirer, and path. I also got learned a lot more about readmes
I had difficulty with some of the functions and getting the right syntax
For future development, i would like to add more licenses
